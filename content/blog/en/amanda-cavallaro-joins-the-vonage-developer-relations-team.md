Oi! Ciao! 

I am Amanda, an Italo-Brazilian developer advocate at Vonage based in the United Kingdom. 

During my free time, I practise aikido, read books, study Japanese and listen to power metal. My favourite band is Sonata Arctica. 

I am passionate about cloud technologies, JavaScript, human-computer interactions and ambient computing and a love of learning. You can speak to me in Portuguese, English, Italian and a little Japanese.

I am thoroughly interested and invested in conversational technologies through different communication channels.  I have developed a deep interest in these interactions can improve our lives and make technology more inclusive for people from different backgrounds.

I am a volunteer community builder at [Bots Brasil](https://medium.com/botsbrasil) and [GDG Cloud London](https://www.meetup.com/gdgcloud/). I am a [Women Techmakers](https://www.womentechmakers.com/) ambassador and a [Google Developers Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts).

Having worked as a developer for the past six years, I understand developers' pain points. In addition to that, I have the passion and empathy to communicate and help empower people to reach their goals and achievements.  

I feel privileged to choose a profession where I can make a difference in developers' careers and learning journeys. I love to connect and collaborate with others. I will share what I learn through public speaking, talks, workshops, videos, blog posts and overall creating content that brings value. 

Feel free to follow me on Twitter and ask me questions.

Thanks for reading. Hope to see you soon!
