# Introducing Vonage for Visual Studio Code

We're always working to make building with our APIs easier for all developers.
With our new Vonage for Visual Studio Code extension, we're bringing our APIs
closer to your development experience. Vonage for VS Code gives you full
control of your Vonage applications &amp; numbers and provides code snippets to
make building your app faster than ever.

Let's review what you can do.

## Installing the Extension 

You can find the Vonage for VS Code extension in the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vonage.vscode).
Click **install** to add the extension to your editor.

Alternatively, you can manually install the plugin:

1. See the latest [Releases](https://github.com/Vonage/vscode/releases) for
the Vonage/vscode GitHub project.
1. Download the release.vsix file from the latest release. The link is listed
under the Assets section of the release.
1. Run `code --install-extension <path to release.vsix>` from your terminal.

## Authenticate Your Account

With the extension installed, click the Vonage logo in the activity bar. Then
you'll be prompted to authenticate the extension with your account. Click the
`Provide API key &amp; secret` button to authenticate your account. Once you've
logged in, your account information will begin to populate in the window.
