Hi there, I am Mofi and I am super excited to be joining the developer relations team at Vonage as a Senior Developer Advocate. I will be focusing on client sdks for the video api. 

I have been a developer advocate for about 3 years. The thing I like most about developer advocacy is the ability to break down complex problems and make it easy to understand. I love to talk to other developers to teach and to learn from. 

My developer journey started in high school from our robotics team. Which lead me to major in computer engineering. I initially wanted to do hardware and electronics related work. But then I took some CS courses and started to learn programming. To be honest my first few courses were not the most promising and I was struggling. I almost was thinking of switching out of computer engineering to electrical engineering. But I somehow managed to survive that semester and over the summer I spent some time just playing with coding and it clicked. The moment my understanding went from 0 to 1 was a high I still chase everyday. In many ways that is a feeling I try to replicate when I help others to get to their 0 to 1.

Now after a number of years working as a developer advocate I got to travel all over the country (and abroad), got to speak at a number of conferences, mentored at hackathons, taught workshops for O’Reilly, worked with clients to help with solutions and I could not be happier. This role gives me the opportunity to connect with people, learn new things and teach others and for that I am grateful.

My programming language of choice these days is Go and JS. I am pretty involved with the Go community in NY and am one of the organizers of the Golang NYC meetup. I am strong believer of open source and contributed to a few projects over the years.

I love collecting tech stickers. I have about a box full of them. In my spare time I enjoy board games. My birthday wishlist is just a giant list of board games which makes it very easy for my friends to get me gifts.

I am thrilled to be a part of this community and I can’t wait to work with you all and once things start opening back up again maybe see your faces at conferences.
