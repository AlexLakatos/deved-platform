HI, I'm Nick and have been in the Writing team since mid May 2021. I am looking forward to getting through the  onboarding and being able to contribute. I've been doing a lot of learning about the Vonage agile based Docs as Code pipeline with more to come! 

I was born in the county of Yorkshire in the United Kingdom and currently live in a village in Sussex. My dad was in the Royal Air Force so we we did a lot of moving between RAF bases in the UK and in several countries.  

My hobbies have always included sport, chess, swimming, etc. After a gap of many years I'm now playing for the local Cricketers. I think the talented author Bill Bryson once said cricket was a game of mystery and food breaks. I also play badminton and table tennis in a village club I help to run. As a Parish Councillor I find myself busier than ever, working on local community enterprise and issues. Parish councils are the local version of city, town and county councils, but we don't get paid.

My first career was as a scientist which ended when I was Head of the Hazardous Waste Unit in London and deiced to go into IT. My first IT title was Junior Consultant, after which I was a C/C++ programmer, IT manager, Technical Writer, Trainer, and dabbled in several other areas including relational databases. 

During my early days it IT, I made a decision to work in the Information part of IT. In my opinion Technology is always changing but the information, business or technical, is much the same. 

After a few years as an employee I decided to become a Consultant/Contractor. I felt I could offer my Technical Writing, Training, Policy/Process/Procedure and technical skills to interested clients whilst boosting my knowledge of IT and business. I must have done OK, as my clients include Intel, American Express, WorldPay, Coca-Cola, UNAIDS, Unilever, Accenture, and many others. I specialised in small to medium contracts with with fixed date deliverables. One contract was five days to create a large Technical Guide from scratch and training a Junior Technical Writer to take over the entire document process. Glad to say they are still going. 

When Vonage contacted me to be an employee, I was not sure. But, after speaking with a few team members, it became obvious that this was an opportunity not be be lost. 

I hope that I can bring my wide experience to the Vonage table and I'm enjoying getting to grips with the latest lean technology for document management or Docs as Code. Agile documentation has often been deployed as no documents. The reality is we need to record, collaborate and share knowledge, as opposed to losing it on hard drives or hiding it on local machines.

To the future! üç∏
