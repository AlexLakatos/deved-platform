Hey! I'm Paul Ardeleanu and I'm thrilled to be joining the Developer Relations team at Nexmo, working primarly on the mobile developer experience of our new Client SDK. It is an honour to join such an <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/11/28/all-your-devrel-award-belong-to-us-dr/">amazing crew</a>!

I started programming back in the days of Fortran, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran/Fortran_examples">the programming language that screams at you</a>, and eventually "graduated" to Visual Studio 6, to complete a PhD in Computational Physics from <a href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/">UCLan</a>. My research was part of the Linear Tape-Open (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Tape-Open">LTO</a>) project, the current standard for data centre backup tapes.

These days I enjoy writing words in Swift, Ruby, and, the grandad, Objective-C. Although I'm London-based, you can usually find me <a href="http://www.pardel.net/">speaking</a> at various European events.

If you would like to talk about the Nexmo developer experience or our products, please feel free to connect on the <a href="https://developer.nexmo.com/community/slack">Nexmo Community Slack</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/pardel">Twitter</a>. Looking forward to meeting lots of you and trying your amazing products.

Let's make the world a better place, together!
