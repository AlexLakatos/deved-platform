## Introduction

[Bulk SMS](https://www.bandwidth.com/glossary/bulk-sms/) comes in handy when marketing teams need to do promotional campaigns. Organizations can also deploy them to pass information to a large group of people. 

Problems can arise when you send a bulk SMS campaign meant to generate responses to a large audience. For instance, receiving thousands of inbound responses at once could overwhelm your team. One solution to this problem is to use throttling. For example, you can design a campaign to send the messages in batches, at specific periods, or both. 

This article will teach you how to implement bulk SMS throttling in Python using the Django REST framework and the Vonage Messages API. The web application we will build in this tutorial will allow you to message multiple users in batches at specified time intervals.

[Vonage Messages API](https://developer.nexmo.com/messages/overview) allows developers to develop SMS-based applications and implement messaging features in their apps for SMS, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python framework used for building web applications. [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) allows developers to build [RESTful APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) with Django.

## Prerequisites

1. \[Vonage API account](<https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up>) If you don't have a Vonage API account, you may \[create an account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up) and get free credit.

2. Vonage application - you can follow this \[guide](<https://developer.nexmo.com/messages/code-snippets/create-an-application>) to create an application on your Vonage dashboard.

3. \[Python](https://www.python.org/) - Ensure you have installed version 3.6 or a later version of Python on your development machine. You can download Python from the \[official website](https://www.python.org/).

4. \[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) - Have pip installed and working on your machine. See \[instructions for installing pip here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).Â 

5. \[Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) - Venv is useful for creating isolated virtual environments for Python projects.
